**ydk-gen** is a developer tool that can generate API bindings to YANG data models for, today, Python. Work is underway to support C++, and the ydk-gen may be used as the starting point for supporting bindings to any language.

Other tools and libraries are used to deliver ydk-gen's functionality. In particular:

* YANG model analysis and code generation is implemented as an extension to [pyang](https://github.com/mbj4668/pyang)
* Core libraries are built on [ncclient](https://github.com/ncclient/ncclient)
* Documentation is generated using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/)

Of course, many other libraries are used as an integral part of ydk-gen and its dependencies, too many to mention!

Developers can either use pre-packaged generated code (e.g. [ydk-py](http://cs.co/ydk-py)), or they can define the YANG models that code is to be generated for are specified in a profile file. This gives a developer the ability to customize the scope of their SDK based on their requirements.


##System Requirements:

####Linux
Ubuntu (Debian-based): The following packages must be present in your system before installing YDK-Py:
```
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip zlib1g-dev python-lxml libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev python-dev libboost-dev libboost-python-dev libssh-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libtool-bin
```

Centos (Fedora-based): The following packages must be present in your system before installing YDK-Py:
```
$ sudo yum install epel-release
$ sudo yum install python-pip python-devel libxml2-devel libxslt-devel libssh-devel boost-devel boost-python libcurl-devel libtool gcc-c++
```

####Mac
It is recommended to install homebrew (http://brew.sh) and Xcode command line tools on your system before installing YDK-Py:
```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
$ xcode-select --install
$ brew install boost boost-python pkg-config cmake libssh
```

####Windows
It is recommended to install a python distribution like [PythonXY](https://python-xy.github.io/) on your system before installing YDK-Py

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ydk-gen.git
$ cd ydk-gen
$ pip install -r requirements
```

## Usage

```
$ python generate.py --help
Usage: generate.py [options]

Options:
  --version           show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -p, --python        Generate Python bundle/core. This is currently the default option
  -c, --cpp           Generate C++ bundle/core
  --core              Install the python/C++ core
  --bundle=PROFILE    Take options from a profile file
  --sudo              Use superuser permission (during C++ bundle/core generation if necessary)
  -v, --verbose       Verbose mode
  --generate-doc      Generation documentation
  --output-directory  The output-directory . If not specified the output can be found under `ydk-gen/gen-api/python`
```

### Installing the YDK core

```
python generate.py --core
```

### Bundle profiles

1. Construct a bundle profile file, such as [```ietf_0_1_1.json```](profiles/bundles/ietf_0_1_1.json) and specify its dependencies

2. Generate the bundle using a command of the form:

```
python generate.py --python --bundle profiles/bundles/ietf_0_1_1.json
```

The generated bundle will in ```ydk-gen/gen-api/python``` or ```ydk-gen/gen-api/cpp```.

#### Details

A sample bundle profile file is described below. The file is in a JSON format. The initial section of metadata is mostly ignored for now. It will be used later.

```
{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "Author": "Cisco",
    "Copyright": "Cisco",
    "Description": "Cisco IOS-XR Native Models From Git",
```

The "models" section of the file describes where to source models from. There are 3 sources:

- Directories
- Specific files
- Git, within which specific relative directories and files may be referenced

The sample below shows the use of git sources only.

```
    "models": {
        "git": [
```

We have a list of git sources. Each source must specify a URL. This URL should be one that allows the repository to be cloned without requiring user intervention, so please use a public URL such as the example below. There are three further options that can be specified:

- ```commitid``` - Optional specification of a commit in string form. The files identified will be copied from the context of this commit.
- ```dir``` - List of **relative** directory paths within git repository. All .yang files in this directory **and any sub-directories** will be pulled into the generated SDK.
- ```file```- List of **relative** file paths within the git repository.

Only directory examples are shown below.

```
            {
                "url": "https://github.com/YangModels/yang.git",
                "dir": [
                    "vendor/cisco/xr/532"
                ]
            },
            {
                "url": "https://github.com/YangModels/yang.git",
                "commitid": "f6b4e2d59d4eedf31ae8b2fa3119468e4c38259c",
                "dir": [
                    "experimental/openconfig/bgp",
                    "experimental/openconfig/policy"
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
```

## Notes

YANG Development Kit Generator:

- This is a tool that generates different language bindings (Python, C++ etc). Developers can use these objects/APIs, to write applications
- Also provided are runtime libraries including "services" and "service providers".
    - ServiceProvider: Provides concrete implementation that abstracts underlying protocol details (e.g. `NetconfServiceProvider`, which is based on the NETCONF protocol) 
    - Services: Provides simple API interface to be used with the bindings and providers


### Python version

- If your environment has both python 2 and python 3 and uses python 2 by default, you may need to use 'python3' and 'pip3' instead of 'python' and 'pip' in the commands mentioned in this document.

For Python entities and netconf session, CRUD service invoked on python class will:

- Encode python data objects to netconf XML payload
- Perform transport operation with device, collect the netconf response,
- Decode netconf response in python class, return result to python app.

```
$ python generate.py --core
$ pip install gen-api/python/core/dist/ydk*.tar.gz

$ python generate.py --bundle profiles/test/ydktest.json
$ pip install gen-api/python/ydktest-bundle/dist/ydk*.tar.gz
```

To run the sanity tests, do the following:

```
$ cd ydk-gen/sdk/python
$ python test/test_sanity_types.py
$ python test/test_sanity_levels.py
$ python test/test_sanity_filters.py
```

### C++
First, install the [test](profiles/test/ydktest-cpp.json) bundle and core package
```
$ python generate.py --core --cpp
$ python generate.py --bundle profiles/test/ydktest-cpp.json --cpp
```

To run the core and bundle tests, do the following

```
$ cd ydk-gen/sdk/cpp/ydk
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. && make all test

$ cd ydk-gen/sdk/cpp/tests
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. && make all test
```
