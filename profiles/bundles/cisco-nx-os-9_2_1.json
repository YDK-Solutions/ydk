  "long_description": "This YANG Development Kit (YDK) bundle provides APIs for Cisco NX-OS YANG models. YDK facilitates the use of YANG data models by expressing the model semantics in an API and abstracting protocol/encoding details.  YDK is composed of a core package that defines services and providers, plus one or more module bundles.  This YDK bundle for Cisco NX-OS models uses the YDK core package and additional model bundles.  You can find the SDK documentation at http://ydk.cisco.com/py/docs  You can find more details on YDK at http://ydk.io",
